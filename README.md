# App Designer for beginners

AppDesigner is a visual programming tool provided by MATLAB that allows beginners to create interactive applications without the need for writing complex code. 
With AppDesigner, users can design graphical user interfaces (GUIs) by placing user interface components (such as buttons, text boxes, and graphs) on a design window. 
Then, the functionality of each component can be programmed using a visual programming language. 
AppDesigner is an excellent option for those who want to learn programming and create interactive applications quickly and easily.

This repository contains a series of sample programs designed to help developers learn programming using App Designer.
The tutorials cover a wide variety of topics, from basic programming concepts to more advanced techniques for creating high-quality applications. 
Each program is carefully documented and commented to facilitate learning and understanding for students. 
Additionally, developers also have the option to download and modify the sample programs to fit their own needs and projects. 
In summary, this repository is an essential tool for anyone looking to learn programming with App Designer.
